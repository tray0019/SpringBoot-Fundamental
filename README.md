# Learned
@RestController is a combination of:
- @Controller (makes it a Spring MVC)
- @ResponseBody (returns JSON or text directly in response body)  
	
Spring Bean:
- A Java object that Spring manages for you. Instead of manually creating objects using new, Spring creates them, configures them, and injects them when needed. 
	
@Service annotation:
- Registers the class as Spring bean(automatically managed)
- Mark as part of service layer/business logic layer
