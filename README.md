# SpringBoot-RESTful-API
Understanding SpringRESTful API


# How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Java IDE
3. Compile and run

# Step Took
1. Created Spring Boot Maven project
2. Created POJO class called Topic.  
3. Added my TopicController class for handling RESTFul API
4. Added my TopicService class for business logic
5. Add business logic methods for TopicService class (CRUD)
6. Added my TopicService and use Spring MVC annotations for HTTP request

# Learned
@RestController is a combination of:
- @Controller (makes it a Spring MVC)
- @ResponseBody (returns JSON or text directly in response body)  
	
Spring Bean:
- A Java object that Spring manages for you. Instead of manually creating objects using new, Spring creates them, configures them, and injects them when needed. 
	
@Service annotation:
- Registers the class as Spring bean(automatically managed)
- Mark as part of service layer/business logic layer

@Autowired 
- Inject a spring bean into another class automatically

Automatic main Application.java created
